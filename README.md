# Overview
Creating a new instance of each state is wasteful if you play the game more than once. It would be more efficient to only create one instance of each state. Amend each of the states to be a singleton:
* ``ReadyToPlayState``
* ``StickState``
* ``TwistState``
* ``EndState``

## Setup
* Fork - [https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/oose-2021-22-teaching-team/singletoncardgamestart](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/oose-2021-22-teaching-team/singletoncardgamestart)
* Clone your copy using gitbash
* Open using existing files in your IDE
* If you are interested in pair programming, it is optional, see [video](https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/rec/share/QjQt1zbjuwQGYgMrX1tDDBc-PUqa_CpvxJGI0gV1gvEStOTcGnn55ls_TQVRVbfD.N9qsbYv71kE0iBtJ?startTime=1644928799000),

## Black Jack Assignment Instructions
### ``StickState``
* A private constructor
* A private static unique instance of type StickState
* A public static getInstance to create the unique instance if null and return
* Run tests for ``StickState`` - This verification step to double check everything works.

### ``TwistState``
* Change into a singleton design pattern
* A private constructor
* A private static unique instance of type StickState
* A public static getInstance to create the unique instance if null and return
* Amend any other states that create this state to use getInstance

### ``ReadyToPlayState``
* Change into a singleton design pattern
* A private constructor
* A private static unique instance of type StickState
* A public static getInstance to create the unique instance if null and return
* Amend any other states that create this state to use getInstance

### ``EndState``
* Change into a singleton design pattern
* A private constructor
* A private static unique instance of type StickState
* A public static getInstance to create the unique instance if null and return
* Amend any other states that create this state to use getInstance
